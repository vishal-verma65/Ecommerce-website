This is a practice project of ecommerce website for learning dynammic content creation and also to learn How to work with APIs in JavaScript.
I have used Tempate Tag in this project for dynamically adding the products cards.
Template tag is used for defining structure/fragments of HTML code which does not renders on the page. 
To render the fragment of code, we use javaScript.
