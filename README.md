This is a practice project of ecommerce front-end part of the website for learning dynammic content creation and also to learn How to work with APIs in JavaScript.
I am creating this  project using vite.
I have used Tempate Tag in this project for dynamically adding the products cards.
Template tag is used for defining structure/fragments of HTML code which does not renders on the page. 
To render the fragment of code, we use javaScript.

In this project i have just created the front end part of the website, i have added ,multiple pages, havve created product page in the the user can add products and also remoce it.
Also i have stored the cart products in the local server so that whenever the user opens the webiste, the cart products are in its place.
